The Default&Refine algorithm is a rule-based learning algorithm that was developed as an accurate and efficient
pronunciation prediction mechanism for speech processing systems. The algorithm exhibits a number of attractive properties
including rapid generalization from small training sets, good asymptotic accuracy, robustness to noise in the training
data, and the production of compact rule sets.
